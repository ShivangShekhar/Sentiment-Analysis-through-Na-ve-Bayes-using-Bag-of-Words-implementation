poor reliability 0
it works 1
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0

last time buying from you 0
it was a waste of my money 0
so far it has worked like a charm 1
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1

the bottowm line another worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0
having trouble with volume 0
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1
warning do not buy 0
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0
i didn t want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0
best headset ever 1
don t trust their website and don t expect any helpful support 0
it was that loud glad to say that the plantronics 10 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1
excellent product for the price 1
bad reception 0
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1
great phone 1
don t buy this product it fails 0
everything about this product is wrong first 0
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0
terrible phone holder 0
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1
i love being able to use one headset for both by land line and cell 1
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1
how stupid is that 0
i can hear while i m driving in the car and usually don t even have to put it on it s loudest setting 1
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1
good show samsung 1
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0
couldn t figure it out 0
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wife s phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldn t understand a word being said on it 0
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0

saggy floppy piece of junk 0
much better than the hard plastic cases 1
it also had a new problem 0

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0
but it is great i would really recommend it 1
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when i m not wearing it 0
as i said above pretty useless 0
never got it 0
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had sound wise 0
down the drain because of a weak snap 0
does not charge the cingular att phone 0
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldn t receive and place calls 0
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0
i m returning them 0
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1
nice leather 1
i had to purchase a different case 0
it is a joy to use 1
very much disappointed with this company 0
very satisifed with that 1
it didn t charge for me 0
this is the phone to get for 00 i just bought my s 10a and all i can say is wow 1
buttons are too small 0
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1
love it great armband 1
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0
i exchanged the sony ericson z 00a for this and i m pretty happy with that decision 1
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1
also makes it easier to hold on to 1
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1
it s pretty easy 1
i can not make calls at certain places 0
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn t wake up like normal phone does 0
beautiful styling though 1
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0
i m trying to return it for a refund 0
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0
excellent product 1
earbud piece breaks easily 0
lousy product 0
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it s very ability to be a phone 0
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1
sweetest phone 1
oh the charger seems to work fine 1
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1
not enough volume 0
echo problem very unsatisfactory 0
you could only take videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0
don t waste your money 0
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0
you also can not take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0
phone falls out easily 0
it didn t work people can not hear me when i talk 0
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0
i m really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesn t work 0
painful on the ear 0
lasted one day and then blew up 0
disappointed 0
kind of flops around 0
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0
item does not match picture 0
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0

they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti glare screen protector that i have found to date 1
just what i wanted 1
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0
wont work right or atleast for me 0
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccure bottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0
i really wanted the plantronics 10 to be the right one but it has too many issues for me the good 0
great product 1
crisp and clear 1
after the first charge kept going dead after 1 minutes 0
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0
the reception has been generally good 1
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1
great bluetooth 1
i highly recommend this case 1
worthwhile 1
this is a great deal 1
after my phone got to be about a year old it s been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0
i am sorry i made this purchase 0
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0
treo and t mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0
it was horrible 0
i don t think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0
they work about weeks then break 0
it is simple to use and i like it 1
it s a great tool for entertainment communication and data management oh be sure to use activesync for optimal data synchronization results 1
i can t use this case because the smell is disgusting 0
not what i wanted 0
i own of these cases and would order another 1
great phone 1
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and i m very happy with my purchase 1
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0
perfect for the ps 1
five star plus plus 1
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn t hear me 1
0 down the drain 0
